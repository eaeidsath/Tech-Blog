## Description
    
A tech blog where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts. This site is deployed through Heroku, and can be visited by clicking the link supplied below. Users can create an account, publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well.

Tech blogs are important sites for developers to read and share their ideas about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. Staying up to date with the latest news in the tech world is important for all developers.

Making this tech blog site helped me become very famliar with the Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm and to understand the importance of separation of concerns. This project was my first time building a comprehensive site by handling routes in a controller, defining models, and using Handlebars for the view. I also was able to get practice with user authentication by learning to authenticate application users by verifying their credentials.
